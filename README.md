# Payload CMS for proto.cool

This project is the headless **Payload CMS** that powers my personal website, [proto.cool](https://proto.cool). It is designed to provide a robust CMS for managing content with greater developer flexibility. The project includes structured collections for managing blog content like **Posts**, **Tags**, as well as the core Payload features of **Users** and **Media**. Many features have been collected or extended from official Payload samples, so hopefully what's in this repository can be of some benefit to you! ðŸ’» ðŸš€

## Features

- **Rich Blog Management**: Manage blog posts with rich text content, tags, and customizable metadata.
- **Tags for Categorization**: Assign and manage tags to organize and classify blog posts.
- The default **User System**, **Media Handling**, and **Draft and Version** controls that come with Payload CMS are enabled.
- Builds can be kicked off automatically when Posts are published or modified, providing authors a seamless publishing experience.
- The frontend is largely data-driven from the data stored in Payload. In fact, this repository is used in production for my Payload instance and website, but you can fork it and start writing your own content!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **pnpm**
- **Postgres** or **MongoDB** instance for the database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/proto-cool/proto.cool-payload-cms.git
    cd proto.cool-payload-cms
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URI=postgres://postgres:<password>@127.0.0.1:5432/your-database-name
    PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key
    ```

    Or, if you prefer MongoDB:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
    PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key
    ```

    Replace `your-secret-key` with a secure secret for Payload CMS.

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The CMS dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

5. (Optional) Configure web server to redirect to `/admin`

    I didn't like having my root URL just 404 when the only URLs used for this project are the `/admin` and `/api` endpoints (as well as `/_next` for supporting files). To that end, here is some Caddy configuration I use to redirect that may be of use:

    ```text
    # Match any request that is not /admin or under /api
    @notPayload {
        not path /admin /admin/* /api /api/* /_next /_next/*
    }

    # Redirect those requests to /admin
    redir @notPayload /admin 302
    ```
