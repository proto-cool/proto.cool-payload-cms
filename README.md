# Payload CMS for proto.cool

This project is the headless **Payload CMS** that powers my personal website, [proto.cool](https://proto.cool). It is designed to provide a robust CMS for managing content with greater developer flexibility. The project includes structured collections for managing blog content like **Posts**, **Tags**, as well as the core Payload features of **Users** and **Media**. Many features have been collected or extended from official Payload samples, so hopefully what's in this repository can be of some benefit to you! ðŸ’» ðŸš€

## Features

- **Rich Blog Management**: Manage blog posts with rich text content, tags, and customizable metadata.
- **Tags for Categorization**: Assign and manage tags to organize and classify blog posts.
- The default **User System**, **Media Handling**, and **Draft and Version** controls that come with Payload CMS are enabled.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **pnpm**
- **Postgres** or **MongoDB** instance for the database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/proto-cool/proto.cool-payload-cms.git
    cd proto.cool-payload-cms
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URI=postgres://postgres:<password>@127.0.0.1:5432/your-database-name
    PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key
    ```

    Or, if you prefer MongoDB:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
    PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key
    ```

    Replace `your-secret-key` with a secure secret for Payload CMS.

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The CMS dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

5. (Optional) Configure web server to redirect to `/admin`

   I didn't like having my root URL just 404 when the only URLs used for this project are the `/admin` and `/api` endpoints (as well as `/_next` for supporting files). To that end, here is some Caddy configuration I use to redirect that may be of use:

   ```text
   # Match any request that is not /admin or under /api
   @notPayload {
       not path /admin /admin/* /api /api/* /_next /_next/*
   }
   
   # Redirect those requests to /admin
   redir @notPayload /admin 302
   ```
